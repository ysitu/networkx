    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Edges of the graph are expected to have an attribute called
        'capacity'. If this attribute is not present, the edge is
        considered to have infinite capacity.

    s : node
        Source node for the flow.

    t : node
        Sink node for the flow.

    capacity : string
        Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
        that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
        attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
        infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

    two_phase : bool
        If True, a two-phase variant is used. The two-phase variant improves
        the running time on unit-capacity networks from `O(nm)` to
        `O(\min(n^{2/3}, m^{1/2}) m)`. Default value: False.

    Returns
    -------
    flow_value : integer, float
        Value of the maximum flow, i.e., net outflow from the source.

    flow_dict : dictionary
        Dictionary of dictionaries keyed by nodes such that
        flow_dict[u][v] is the flow edge (u, v).

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph. If
        the input graph is an instance of one of these two classes, a
        NetworkXError is raised.

    NetworkXUnbounded
        If the graph has a path of infinite capacity, the value of a
        feasible flow on the graph is unbounded above and the function
        raises a NetworkXUnbounded.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge('x','a', capacity=3.0)
    >>> G.add_edge('x','b', capacity=1.0)
